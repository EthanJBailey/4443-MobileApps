## Backend API and Database

The CaribCoffee app is powered by a FastAPI backend API and MongoDB database. The API provides endpoints for user authentication, coffee spot search, discussion management, and blog post retrieval. MongoDB is used as the database to store user data, coffee spot information, discussion threads, and blog posts.
